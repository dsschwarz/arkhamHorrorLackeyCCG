==FAQ==

Q: How do I load a deck?

A: In the “Deck Editor” tab either select “Browse” to find a premade or previously saved deck, or assemble your deck by double-clicking on the cards you desire in the spreadsheet. Each card that is double-clicked and added to your deck is added to the current Deckzone that that is highlighted. For example, clicking on the Deckzone “Deck” will allow for cards to be loaded to your player deck. Once your deck zone is finished you may load it to the desired location by selecting “Load to your” or “Load to Shared”.

Q: Do I have to load each part of a scenario in (e.g. Encounter Deck, Act Deck, Agenda Deck, etc.)?

A: Yes. You must click on each tab and “Load to shared…” for each separate part of the encounter and player decks. It’s a hassle, sorry.

Q: Is it possible to randomize Basic Weaknesses?

A: Yes! After loading to the table your custom deck through the deck builder, load to the table the Basic_Weaknesses deck from the Browse… menu. Then, you can randomly drag one basic weakness to your deck.

Q: How does the Chaos “Bag” Work?

A: First, you must load a “Chaos Deck” into the shared zone “Chaos”. Do this by selecting the “Chaos” deck zone tab, then clicking Browse… to find the Difficulty level you desire. Then load this set of cards into the shared “Chaos” game zone. At the game table, there is a button called Chaos. Clicking it will draw the top Chaos card to the table, face-up. It is IMPORTANT to shuffle the chaos deck for each new test by right-clicking on the button.

Q: Why is there a 2nd Encounter and 2nd Encounter Discard?

A: Planning for the future I guess!

Q: How do I advance the Agenda and Act Decks?

A: Both of these decks should be loaded to their respective game zones at the game table before beginning play. Simply drag them to and from the table as needed.
